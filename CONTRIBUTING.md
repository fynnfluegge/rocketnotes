We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Getting Started
### Setup dev environment

First, the following tools and frameworks need to be installed on your system prior to start:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Node.js >= 14.x](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v14.x/)
- [Go 1.x](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- [AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html)

Second, fork the repository, and then run the following commands to clone the repository locally.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/{your-account}/rocketnotes.git
$ cd rocketnotes
$ npm install
```

#### 1. Start DynamoDB and docker network
```
$ docker-compose up -d
```
#### 2. Init tables and create data for default user
```
$ sh ./dynamodb-init.sh
```
#### 3. Build and start Lambda functions with AWS SAM
```
$ sam build
$ sam local rocketnotes-serverless-api --docker-network rocketnotes_local-serverless-network --warm-containers EAGER 
```
#### 4. Start Angular app
```
$ export BASE_API_URL="http://localhost:3000"
$ cd webapp
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```
Open http://localhost:4200 in your browser and you should see the Rocketnotes webapp with the cheat sheet of the default user displayed.

> **_NOTE:_**  Authentication is disabled in dev environment.

2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
