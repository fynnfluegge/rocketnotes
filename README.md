## 🙌 Contributing

A good way to do the first contribution are the [good first issues](https://github.com/fynnfluegge/rocketnotes/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
On some of the issues are already linked PRs with comments in the code what has to be done. These PRs can be picked up if not assigned to someone yet.

The most comfortable way to get started is to open the project in a ready-to-code Gitpod workspace with all packages & tools preinstalled and a running database with sample data.

## 🛟 Troubleshooting

- ### Apple could not verify “rocketnotes” is free of malware that may harm your Mac or compromise your privacy.
  - This happens since the `dmg` file was not build with an official Apple developer license. To circumvent this, open Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Security -> "rocketnotes" was blocked to protect your Mac -> Open Anyway
